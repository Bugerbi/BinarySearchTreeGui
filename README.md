# Visualizing data in a Binary Search Tree
The goal of this project is to be able to visualize data in a Binary Search Tree (BST). 

What's unique about BST's is that the value of the data in the left child node is less than the value in its parent node, and the value stored in the right child node is greater than the parent. This makes searching for a value more efficient than other searching methods (data stored in an array or linked list, for example). 

# Objectives
- Load data into a BST from a text file
- Save data from a BST into a text file
- Insert nodes graphically, after the BST has already been built
- Delete nodes graphically (by clicking on the node)

# Design
This project is programmed completely in C++ using the Qt GUI framework. The Qt framework allows for advanced graphical programming and efficient drawing. 

## Why C++
I chose to build this project in C++ for the learning experience. I have wanted to learn C++ since I became a college student so I decided I would learn by working on a project. Java may have been a better option for this sort of project since it has strong GUI support (the swing library), but again, I wanted to learn C++. 

## Why Qt?
I chose to use Qt as the GUI framework because of its full documentation. There is almost no other C++ GUI library out there with documentation as good as Qt. Qt's documentation has made it a lot easier learning how to use Qt.
